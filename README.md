                           Virtual Assistant (Siri) Web Application
                           ________________________________________

A simple voice-controlled Virtual Assistant built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This assistant listens to user commands and responds with appropriate actions, such as opening websites, telling the time, or answering basic queries. The project uses the Web Speech API for speech recognition and synthesis.


Features:-

  •	Speech recognition to listen to user commands.
  •	Voice response using the Speech Synthesis API.
  •	Open websites and apps based on voice commands.
  •	Greet the user based on the time of day.
  •	Display the recognized speech and provide a user-friendly interface.

Prerequisites:-

 Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
  •	A web browser (preferably Google Chrome).
  •	A code editor like VS Code.
  •	Git installed on your computer.

Project Structure:-

  	virtual-assistant/         # Root folder of the project
  	│
	├── index.html             # Main HTML file - Contains the structure of the page
	├── style.css              # CSS file - Contains styles for the web page
	├── script.js              # JavaScript file - Contains the logic for the virtual assistant
	│
	└── README.md       # Documentation file - Contains the project setup and detail

Steps to Set Up the Project:-

  Follow the steps below to create and run the Virtual Assistant project from scratch:
    Step 1: Create the Project Folder
            1.	Create a new folder on your local machine where you want to store the project.
                bash
                Copy code
                mkdir virtual-assistant
                cd virtual-assistant

    Step 2: Create the Project Files
         Inside your virtual-assistant folder, create the following files:
               1. index.html – The main HTML file that defines the structure of the page.
               2. style.css – The CSS file for styling the page.
               3. script.js – The JavaScript file for implementing the logic of the virtual assistant.
    Step 3: Run the Project Locally
               1. Open the index.html file in your browser.
               2. You will see a microphone button. Click on it and start speaking your commands.
               3. The assistant will respond to commands like:

                  o	"Open YouTube" – Opens YouTube.
                  o	"What is the time?" – Tells the current time.
    Step 4: Deployment (Optional)
         For deployment, you can use GitHub Pages or any other static hosting service. Here's how to deploy using GitHub Pages:
               1. Go to your GitHub repository.
               2. Navigate to Settings > Pages.
               3. Under Source, select main branch.
               4. Your website will be deployed at https://username.github.io/virtual-assistant/.

Future Enhancements
    • Add more voice commands and functionalities.
    • Implement a smarter NLP system for more advanced responses.
    • Integrate with APIs for weather updates, news, and other useful services.
